# World_Weather_Analysis

 Overview

This analysis looks at different weather patterns around the global and offers insights to travelers who want to book a trip. 
There are three folders here that offer different levels of analysis: weather database, vacation search, and vacation itinerary.

### Weather Database

This folder uses Open Weather Map API to pull weather information on over 720 different cities around the world. 
That information consists of:
1. Maximum Temperature
2. Cloudiness
3. Wind Speed
4. Humidity
5. Current Weather Description
These different categories of information make it easy for travelers to choose exactly what they are looking for in a travel destination.
